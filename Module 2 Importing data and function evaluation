# Define the vector
assignment2 <- c(16, 18, 14, 22, 27, 17, 19, 17, 17, 22, 20, 22)

# Original function as written (contains mistakes)
myMean <- function(assignment2) {
  return(sum(assignment) / length(someData))
}

# Try running the function (will produce an error)
myMean(assignment2) # Error: object 'assignment' not found

# --- Corrected version ---

# Define the corrected function
myMean <- function(assignment2) {
  return(sum(assignment2) / length(assignment2))
}

# Now run the function again
myMean(assignment2) # Should output [1] 19.25
